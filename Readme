### Memento Pattern and SOLID Principles

The Memento pattern addresses issues related to coupling and composition that can compromise the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) of SOLID. Without the Memento pattern, if we remove the `History` class, the `Editor` class would be responsible for maintaining history. This would involve adding code like `List<EditorState> states = new ArrayList<>()` directly in the `Editor` class, thus violating SRP by forcing the `Editor` class to handle both editing and history maintenance.

In the context of the Memento pattern, we introduce a `History` class to manage the state history. With this pattern, the `List<EditorState> states = new ArrayList<>()` code resides within the `History` class. Consequently, the `History` and `EditorState` classes maintain a composition relationship. This approach preserves SRP because the `History` class is solely responsible for managing history, while the `Editor` class focuses exclusively on editing.
